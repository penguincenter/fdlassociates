<a name=businessplan></a>
<h2>Business Plans</h1>

<p>A complete, professionally prepared business plan is an absolute necessity
for those of you who are seeking capital.  There are actually
institutions who will reject your application immediately simply because 
your plan is not correctly prepared.  Of particular importance is the
Executive Summary, which effectively should be your "best foot
forward."  If this is not prepared correctly the rest of your plan may
not be looked at. </p>

<p>Remember the folks you are sending this to get literally hundreds
of plans so they need a "weeding out" process.  Their thoughts are
that if you have not been thorough and professional in preparing the
most important document of your life why should they think that you
would run your business differently?</p>

<p>The professionals at FDL know what the components of a good plan
are what their contents should be.  For example, the typical
answer we hear our initial inquiry about projections is that they are
"conservative."  That's nice.  Our response is "are they reasonable and
do you have a rational for them?"  If you are deliberately
understating projections you are doing yourself a disservice.  As we
will certainly repeat, your business plan is a SALES TOOL.  Let's put
your "best foot foward."</p>

<p>It is our objective to help you create a unique, professional plan,
which reveals your company in the best possible light.  We work with
you to be certain that all major topics are covered and all financial
information is supportable.</p>

<p>Naturally all plans will be different in the extent and nature of their
content, but we begin with the following suggested format: </p>

<ol>

<li> Cover page

<li> Executive Summary

<li> Table of Contents

<li> History and Description of the Company

<li> Product and/or Service

<li> Visual Aids (photos, brochures, etc.)

<li> Market Analysis and Competition

<li> Your Strengths and Weaknesses

<li> Selling Strategies and Related Communications

<li> Operations (how the enterprise is run)

<li> Management and Ownership (names and condensed resumes)

<li> Goals - Sales, Product, Personnel, Plant - Interrelate

<li> Funds Required - use and exit strategy

<li> Financials Section - recent (last 3 years) historical financial
should prepared by a CPA, current interim and 3 years projections with
reconciled cash flow

<li> Appendices and exhibits

</ol>

<p>Depending on the complexity and volume of the plan our proposal
may include not only the contracting of professionals such as CPAs,
writers, and printers but also in an effort to cut costs the use of your
own staff where appropriate.  Simpler plans (7 - 10 pages) we are
generally able to complete with just your cooperation.  In any case we
work closely with you to avoid interruptions to your business and
still get this plan done.</p>

<p>Business Plans are done for fixed fees based on the complexity of
the plan plus the cost of printing whatever numbers of books you
wish.  As an incentive to you to sign a capital search contract with
us offer a credit for half of the business plan fee off your success
fee if we are able to find you a funder.</p>

<a name=equitysearch></a>
<h2>Equity Capital</h1>

<p>We are one of the premiere venture capital search groups.  It is
our job to introduce you to individuals or institutions that become
interested enough in your business to invest their hard-earned money
in it.  We know who they are, where they are located and what they
expect of people who apply to them.  We identify funders, present your
preliminary information and after they have indicated an interest in
your firm, introduce you.  Ultimately it is you who must convince the
investor he would do well to give you what you need.  YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INFORMATION.  For the most part investors want to
deal directly with the owner or principal officer of the firm seeking
capital.  If you wish we'll be glad to be with you during your crucial
presentation supporting you in anyway we can.  However, the investor's
questions will almost always be directed at you so you must be thoroughly
familiar with your material. </p>

<p>Our clientele is diverse and includes firms in the education,
health care, entertainment, real estate and hi-tech fields.  The
underlying principle which we look for in our clients remain
people.  We expect our clients to be ethical and devoted no only to
their business responsibilities but their personal commitments as
well. </p>

<p>We will work with any stage company, private or public.  We define
the various stages as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li> <b>Seed</b> - Your business plan may or may not be complete.
Founder is usually the only employee.

<li> <b>Early</b> - Your business plan is complete.  Some managers and
employees on board.  Development of the product has begun.  There is
no prototype or first prototype is incomplete.

<li> <b>Mid</b> - Key and many support positions are filled.  One or
two strategic relationships are in place.  Prototype is complete.
First offering may be available and/or is being used by a client.
Your company is on the verge of sales growth in one or two quarters
based on financing.

<li> <b>Late</b> - Professional management and significant
infrastructure are in place.  Multiple customers and strategic
relationships are also in place.  Sales are beginning to accelerate.

<li> <b>Emerging</b> - You are fully operational and your brand
developed.  You are poised for the next level of growth.  There is
market acceptance of your product.  You have relevant sales and are
close to profitability.

</ul>

<p>As our mission statement states you engage us on a success fee
basis in an attempt to identify a source willing to provide the funds
you need.  Fees are determined based on the maturity of your firm and
size of your request.</p>


<a name=commercialloans></a>
<h2>Nationwide Commercial Loan and Mortgage Group</h1>

<p>If your company needs funding in the form of debt for working capital
or property acquisitions or other reasons, you would think that you
could turn to your banker.  In theory he would know about your company
and the ingredients of probable success it has gathered.</p>

<p>If your firm is established, he might even proudly state how he
knows it inside and out.  However, one day when you ask him for
money, "real money", you could be amazed how much he knows about your
deficiencies and how little he knows about your strengths.
Unfortunately, his ignorance is not his problem, IT IS YOURS.  You
must educate him in order to solve the problem.  The solution comes
down to communications, clear, persuasive communications!  Some of it
is spoken and some of it is in the form of a written proposal.</p>

<p>Your bank may or may not be a good place to begin your search, as
it is possible your financing requirements may exceed your bank's
capacity or that the institution most interested in lending your type
of business is someone other than your banker.  They may be located in
your city or elsewhere in the nation.  We can work with you REGARDLESS
OF YOUR LOCATION, as the lenders whom we submit our clients' proposals
are nationwide.</p>

<p>We know how easy it is for you to think of a lender as an obstacle
to your success.  Instead we help you think of the loan officer as
someone who would absolutely write you the check you need if only he
or she saw all the components of your business and not just your
balance sheet.  Remember he also needs to do business to make
money.</P>

<p>The lender actually has an open mind and you need to fill it with the
knowledge of what really makes your company tick.  You will deliver
this information in person, sometimes in the form of a detailed
business plan.</P>

<p>Your success in obtaining the capital you seek will hinge on your
ability to show exactly why your company deserves it.</P>

powerful sales tool that is your own VENDOR LEASING PROGRAM.</p>
